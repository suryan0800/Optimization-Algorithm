Formula Slide: 

These are the formulas that we use in our algorithm

Xi represents each point in the search area. 
Let us assume that our search area is a wall. we know the temperature at each point in the wall.

we reandomly take N points , those points are Xi
i represent each point

xi,t is current position of the point in the wall
xi,t+1 is next position of that point in the wall
To find the next position, we use pace formula

To calculate pace, we use fitness weight, in this x* represents the point with best fitness. x represents the point which we are going to move. 

wf is weight factor. it can be either 0 or 1 . When it is 1, high level
of convergence and a low chance of coverage occurs. 
otherwise, it dosen't affect the algorithm

When we have a point which is also having best fitness currently, or when the point has a fitness value of 0 , we find pace by randomly generating a number from -1 to 1 and multiplying it with that point . 

Else, we find pace by multiplying the distance between the best point and current point with fitness weight


FLow Chart Slide : 

We first select N random points 
We find the best point among them using fitness function
we find pace and fitness weight for a point in X , if the fitness value is greater than previous fitness, we update that point
Else we find pace using last pace in which we moved that point, again we find fitness value, if it is greater that previous fitness, we move the point

else we go for a random walk.

We do the above process repeatedly for M iterations. Or untill no other point is moved further. 

when completed , we will be having N updated points , from which , The best fitness point is the optimal solution.
